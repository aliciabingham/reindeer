##Description
One of our first simple JavaScript exercises, this one taught us (and gave us practice with) using the for loop principal. With a for loop, we were asked to take the properties of two arrays and sandwich them together, side by side.


##How To Run
In your terminal, run command ```http-server -p 4040```.

Navigate to 127.0.0.1:4040 in your browser.
